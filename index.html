<p>Hey! This is the support page for my HSC Major Work, a desktop application I wrote for Windows PC's that can generate a maze and then find the most efficient route to the solution. It's written in C# and uses WPF. It features Depth First Search, and A*. If you'd like to play around with it please use the online installer, if you wanna check out the source code it's stored here, and if you want to see the documentation that's available too!</p>

<h3>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h3>

<p>To getup and running download setup.exe by clicking Online Install above. Once downloaded run the file your computer might produce a warning when this occurs, that's normal and perfectly safe to ignore for this application. After this the program will download some extra files from GitHub that are essential for it to run, at a later date it may download more if an update has occurred. Once the install has finished the application will run, and will remain installed on your machine.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="tutorial" class="anchor" href="#tutorial" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tutorial</h3>

<ol>
<li>To start enter the length of your grid. A value between 30 and 80 will produce quite a simple maze, 81 - 120 are reasonably challenging and 121 - 150 are quite difficult. Any maze with a length above 150 will take a very long time to generate on most machines. </li>
<li>Click generate and your maze will begin to be built!</li>
<li>Once the generation has finished the maze will appear on the screen, you can then use the arrow keys to begin, you start at the bright green location and need to reach the red point to solve the maze and win!</li>
<li>If you get stuck or want to see the most efficient route possible hit solve, and the A* algorithm will find the most efficient manner to the end and produce a light green path from beginning to end.</li>
<li>Hit clear and you'll be able to generate a new maze randomly.</li>
</ol>

<p>Happy Maze Solving!</p>

<p>If you no longer want the program on your system you can uninstall like any other application by going to Programs and Features and clicking uninstall. </p>
